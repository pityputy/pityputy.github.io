  <h2>Islands</h2>
  <p>
    Life is like an ocean.<br>
And I am a little boat.<br>
Sailing through all the Chaos, a great thunderstorm.<br>
I throw the anchor overboard sometimes.<br>
Spend some time on an island.<br>
If I can see flowers blooming on its meadows as I sail by.<br>
Sometimes I find one that is unique, small and hard to see from afar.<br>
But I cannot ever stay forever.<br>
I set sail again and again, but I never forget the islands and the seas.<br>
I make a map in my head.<br>
I would draw it, if I were a better artist.<br>
And sometimes I use this map to go back.<br>
Then I wonder how time flew by so fast.<br>
Because the islands change a lot while I’m gone.<br>
I wish I could find one that makes me want to stay.<br>
One that has a lighthouse.<br>
A lighthouse that draws me in, like a little boat in a storm.<br>
A lighthouse where I can stay forever.<br>
