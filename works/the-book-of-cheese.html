  <h2>The Book of Cheese</h2>
  <h3>Gilvert</h3>
  <p><strong>1 - The First Teaching</strong></p>
  <p><sup>1</sup>For whom the bells toll, for whom a thousand ships have sailed out to sea. For our protector, caretaker, guardian and wise leader, The Great Feta. <sup>2</sup>May thy wisdom guide us through the winding path called life.</p>
  <p><sup>3</sup>As a young lad I believed in fairy tales. But they were more real than reality sometimes. <sup>4</sup>I lived in a small town, with a name not worthy of mentioning in such a sacred book. <sup>5</sup>One day, exactly on the forty-seventh of Besiry I walked out to the fields where I felt a calling I never felt before. <sup>6</sup>The calling turned my head to the East where laid the Boobobaga Mountains. Peaks so high you could see through the Hole of the Doughnut standing atop.</p>
  <p><sup>7</sup>With determination I never felt before I trod through the mud. My consciousness has left my body. <sup>8</sup>I saw a weary traveller boy bewitched by some supernatural spirit whose intentions were unbeknownst to him like they were to anybody watching. <sup>9</sup>Nobody stood there though, but for the mole-people who lived right under the town. <sup>10</sup>The boy didn’t even look at them as he walked by. <sup>11</sup>The calling didn&#39;t care about others’ opinion.</p>
  <p><sup>12</sup>I was the boy. The boy was me, yet I wasn’t the one in charge. It was the One in charge. <sup>13</sup>Or One of the Ones. I didn’t know back then.</p>
  <p><sup>14</sup>I marched for days without any food or water, my Guide gave me strength. <sup>16</sup><em>If thy will is strong, so is thy body and mind.</em> said the Calling one day.</p>
  <p><sup>17</sup>On the eighth day of my voyage I reached the mountains. I climbed and climbed up the rocky walls, just as the Voice told me. <sup>18</sup>By the eleventh morning I greeted the rising sun standing on the mountainside looking down on the Doughnut below.</p>
  <p><sup>18</sup>When I turned I saw beauty resting at the top. A grand piece of cheese that had a calming presence. <sup>19</sup>Its wisdom beaming out into the air filling all the eager listeners like me with courage to find It.</p>
  <p><sup>20</sup><em>I sense thou art one of the curious ones.</em> said Its voice in my head. <em>I have all the answers to thy questions. Thou just hast to ask.</em></p>
  <p><sup>21</sup><em>How would I ask?</em> I said out loud. <em>If even I, myself don’t know the questions?</em></p>
  <p><sup>22</sup><em>Is that a question? Do thou wantest me to answer that?</em></p>
  <p><sup>23</sup><em>I don’t know.</em></p>
  <p><sup>24</sup><em>Think again. If thou art asking yourself that question thou art in the wrong place. Come back when thou knowest what wantest to ask.</em></p>
  <p><sup>25</sup>I walked away but without shame. I knew I would come back, and this was only the first lesson. <sup>26</sup>I found my new Master.</p>
